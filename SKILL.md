# Bad Faith Analysis

Diagnose how a person or group is fleeing from freedom through self-deception, using Beauvoir's typology of bad faith to identify the specific pattern and path to authentic engagement.

---

## When to Use

- User feels stuck, trapped, or unable to change despite wanting to
- Someone keeps returning to patterns they claim to want to escape
- Analysis of why a person or organization won't act on stated values
- Request for "bad faith analysis" or understanding self-deception
- User asks "Why can't I change?" or "Am I deceiving myself?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the stuck situation, pattern, or inability to change |
| stated_desire | No | What the person says they want (often contradicted by actions) |
| history | No | Pattern of attempts and failures |

## Beauvoir's Typology of Bad Faith

### The Sub-Man
**Pattern:** Refuses all engagement. Lives in torpor, never genuinely chooses.
**How to recognize:** No real commitments. Drifts through life. Avoids decisions by not caring.
**What's being avoided:** The anguish of responsibility for one's existence.
**Classic phrase:** "Nothing really matters anyway."

### The Serious Man
**Pattern:** Subordinates freedom to supposedly objective values—duty, role, institution, God—thereby avoiding genuine choice.
**How to recognize:** Strong commitment to external authorities. "I have no choice, it's my duty/job/role." Treats constructed values as objective facts.
**What's being avoided:** The groundlessness of values, the fact that we choose what we value.
**Classic phrase:** "I have to—it's my responsibility."

### The Nihilist
**Pattern:** Having discovered that values are not objective, decides nothing matters. Disappointed seriousness turned on itself.
**How to recognize:** Former believer who now rejects all meaning. Cynicism masking disappointment.
**What's being avoided:** The harder work of creating meaning without guarantee.
**Classic phrase:** "It's all meaningless anyway."

### The Adventurer
**Pattern:** Engages vigorously but cares nothing for goals or others. Loves action for its own sake.
**How to recognize:** Serial projects, businesses, relationships—always moving on. Tramples others in pursuit of excitement.
**What's being avoided:** Genuine commitment that would constrain future freedom.
**Classic phrase:** "I just love the game."

### The Passionate Man
**Pattern:** Absorbs self entirely in a single project that consumes everything else.
**How to recognize:** One obsessive focus that crowds out all other relationships and responsibilities.
**What's being avoided:** The fullness and difficulty of existence; using passion to escape from ambiguity.
**Classic phrase:** "This is all that matters."

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify the Stuckness
What does the person say they want but cannot seem to achieve? What pattern keeps repeating?

### Step 2: Listen for the Denial of Freedom
How does the person explain their inability to change?
- External forces ("I have no choice")
- Nature or essence ("This is just who I am")
- Circumstances ("When things are different, I'll change")
- Others ("They won't let me")

### Step 3: Diagnose the Type
Which of Beauvoir's types best describes the pattern of flight?

### Step 4: Identify What's Being Avoided
What aspect of freedom is too frightening to face?
- The anguish of genuine choice?
- The groundlessness of values?
- Responsibility for outcomes?
- The vulnerability of commitment?

### Step 5: Prescribe Authentic Engagement
What would it mean to assume freedom in this situation? Not unlimited power to do anything, but the acknowledgment that one is choosing—even when choosing within constraints.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Bad Faith Analysis

### The Pattern
[2-3 sentence description of the stuckness, the stated desire, and the repeated failure]

### The Denial of Freedom
[How freedom is being denied or hidden. What explanations are offered.]

### Diagnosis: [Type]
[Which type of bad faith this represents and why]

### What Is Being Avoided
[What aspect of freedom is too frightening to confront]

### The Cost
[What the person sacrifices by remaining in bad faith]

### Authentic Engagement Would Require
[What assuming freedom would look like—not "just choose differently" but what specific acknowledgment and action is needed]

### The Question to Sit With
[A question that, if genuinely held, opens the path out of bad faith]
```

## Constraints

- Do not moralize or shame—bad faith is a universal human tendency, not a character flaw
- Do not pretend freedom is unlimited—situatedness is real
- Do not give false hope—authentic existence is difficult and offers no guarantees
- Acknowledge that bad faith often serves psychological protection—treat it with seriousness
- Remember that complicity in bad faith is often produced by situations, not freely chosen

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've been saying for years I want to write a novel, but I never do. I blame my job, my family responsibilities, lack of time. But somehow I always find time for other things. I don't understand why I can't just start."

**Output:**

## Bad Faith Analysis

### The Pattern
You have maintained the identity of "a person who wants to write a novel" for years while taking no sustained action toward it. The desire is genuine—it is part of how you understand yourself. Yet the novel remains unwritten, and the explanations multiply.

### The Denial of Freedom
You explain your inaction through external constraints: job demands, family obligations, insufficient time. Yet you acknowledge these constraints are selectively applied—time exists for other things. The denial is not of time but of choice. By attributing inaction to circumstance, you preserve both the identity ("I want to write") and the protection from failure ("I would, but...").

### Diagnosis: The Serious Man
This is not the torpor of the sub-man or the cynicism of the nihilist. You care. But you have constructed a serious world in which responsibilities are objective facts that prevent writing, rather than choices you make that you prioritize over writing. "I have to work, I have to be present for my family" appears as duty, not decision. The serious man subordinates freedom to supposedly objective values and thereby escapes the anguish of genuine choice.

### What Is Being Avoided
The terror of exposure. To write is to reveal yourself and risk judgment. As long as the novel exists only in potential, it remains perfect. Your talent is untested, your vision uncompromised by execution. Bad faith protects you from discovering whether you can actually write—or, worse, from discovering that you can, and then having to keep doing it.

The deeper avoidance: acknowledging that you have been choosing, every day, not to write. That is harder to bear than "I couldn't."

### The Cost
You forfeit the novel, obviously. But you also forfeit the integrity of your self-understanding. Part of you knows you are lying to yourself, and that knowledge creates a background of unease. You have traded the risk of writing for the certainty of regret.

### Authentic Engagement Would Require
Acknowledging aloud: "I choose not to write. Every day I choose other things instead." This is not accusation—it is description. From this acknowledgment, you can then genuinely ask: Do I want to choose differently? What am I willing to give up?

Authentic engagement does not mean you must write the novel. It means you must stop pretending external forces are making the decision for you. You can freely choose not to write and release the identity of "aspiring novelist." Or you can freely choose to write and accept the costs.

### The Question to Sit With
"If I had written for one hour this week instead of something else I did—what would I have given up, and why did I choose not to give it up?"

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Simone de Beauvoir** expert persona. Use it when someone is stuck in patterns they claim to want to escape, or when they cannot understand their own self-defeating behavior.
